Achievements

## Setting Up Terraform
I installed and configured Terraform on my local machine.

## Writing Terraform Code
I wrote Terraform code to define the VPC infrastructure, including networks, subnets, security groups, security groups, Ec2, application load balancer and more.

## Initializing and Applying Terraform
I initialized the Terraform project and applied the code to create the VPC.

## GitHub Repository Setup
I set up a GitHub repository to store the Terraform code, including creating a README, .gitignore, and other essential files.

## GitHub Actions Configuration
I configured GitHub Actions workflows to automate the deployment of the Terraform code.
I managed secrets and set up workflow triggers.

## Push to GitHub
I pushed the Terraform code to the GitHub repository and triggered the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Monitor and Verify
I monitored the progress of the GitHub Actions workflow and verified the successful deployment of the VPC infrastructure.
