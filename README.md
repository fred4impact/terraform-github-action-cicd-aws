# Terraform GitHub Actions CI-CD AWS

This project involves creating AWS infrastructure to deploy a web server using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform modules and establishing a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process upon any changes.
## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Set up and configure Terraform for infrastructure management.
- Write and manage Terraform modules to define resources like VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, and application load balancers across multiple availability zones.
- Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically trigger builds and deployments when changes are pushed to the repository.
